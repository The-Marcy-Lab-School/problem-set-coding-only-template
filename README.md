### Directions
Clone this lab. 

### For Short Responses:

1. Your written response questions are in the `short-response.md` file.

2. Record your answers without removing the original questions.

3. Use complete sentences and style appropriately with markdown.

### For Coding Exercises:

1. From your project's root folder, run `npm install` to load project dependencies.

2. Your coding files are in the `problems` folder: 
    * `README.md` Your instructions and decription of the problems. 
    * `exercises.js` Where you will code your solutions.
    * `exercises.test.js` Your test cases.
    * `index.html` You can optionally open this file in the browser to run your code.

3. Test your code often by running `npm test`. 

4. Check for style by running `eslint problems/exercises.js` in the terminal. If you get an error `eslint: command not found`, run `npm install -g eslint` first.

When you are done with both sections. Push your final commits and submit your URL through Canvas.
